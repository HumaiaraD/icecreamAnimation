# icecreamAnimation
A simple Ice Cream animation created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GSAP, SVG.
I Illustrated a very simple ice cream through Adobe and then converted my file into svg. I used gsap for the first time to do the animation. I have attached the file with codes. Also attached a picture of the illustration in action. The whole video is on my linkedIn account.
