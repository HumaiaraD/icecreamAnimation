A simple Ice Cream animation created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GSAP, SVG.
I Illustrated a very simple ice cream through Adobe and then converted my file into svg. I used gsap for the first time to do the animation. I have attached the file with codes. Also attached a picture of the illustration in action. The whole video is on my linkedIn account. 

The animation begins with three ice cream scoops (#scoop1, #scoop2, #scoop3) initially hidden above the screen.This gives the impression that the scoops are coming from off-screen to land in place. As the animation progresses, each scoop sequentially drops down with a playful bounce, utilizing GSAP's bounce.out easing function for a natural, gravity-driven motion. The first scoop (#scoop1) drops with the most dramatic bounce, landing at y: 150, while the other two scoops follow with slightly smaller bounces, landing at y: 99 and y: 92 respectively. The timing of each scoop's appearance is staggered by 0.5 seconds, creating a rhythm as they fall into view.

After the scoops are settled in place, the .text elements emerge into place.
